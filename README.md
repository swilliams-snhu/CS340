I am sure to comment my code so that way others (as well as myself in the future) can follow along with my train of thought and what the code is intended to do. I am a big fan of using the iterative or modular approach to software development. It is very important and advantageous to ensure that your code works as you develop so you can narrow down where the bugs live when you find one. I will likely use this CRUD module for reference in the future should I even work with MongoDB.

I would continue to approach issues iteratively. I would make sure tht smaller pieces work before I progressed onto other items to make sure that the program would work as intended whenever I press run. This is how I've approached virutually all of my assignments throughout my time at SNHU.

Having data at your disposal is very important. Computer scientists can help companies and groups organize their data and view it more conveniently than they likely could on their own.
